awareOfNewClaims,Are you aware of any circumstances at the company which might give rise to a claim under this insurance policy?,,,,,"When obtaining a Coalition quote, you're asked whether a prospective insured has had a prior incident or claim. Coalition does not disqualify anyone from coverage due to past claims. Often we see that organizations that have experienced incidents in the past and have made investments to harden their cyber defenses are among the most protected. Since Coalition insurance includes full prior acts by default, you will be asked for details of any incident."

dualControl,"Does company require a secondary means of communication to validate the authenticity of funds transfers (ACH, wire, etc.) requests before processing a request in excess of $25,000?",,,,,"Phishing and email spoofing are very common, and it is no longer safe to assume that the information you receive in an email is accurate. One area where we see this result in substantial loss is funds transfer fraud – also referred to as social engineering and cybercrime. Implementing a dual control process when making funds transfers can help prevent fraudulent activity and enabling dual control qualifies organizations for Coalition's Funds Transfer Fraud (FTF) coverage."

wantsTechEo,Would you like to include Coalition technology errors and omissions coverage in the quote?,,,,,"Technology E&O is a type of insurance designed to cover providers of technology services or products.
